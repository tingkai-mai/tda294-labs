I used acceptance mode in SPIN to verify my answer, as we expect that eventually, statusA and statusB will be both ok. This is because this is an example of a liveliness property, and we eventually expect that both statusA and statusB will be ok if Alice communicates successfully with Bob.

"How would weak fairness affect the answer?" idk
